Thie website is designed for a imaginary grocery store, Parayo, to sell a number of fresh produce, meat and dairy products.

By making this static website, I learned:

* proper Viewport settings for mobile device width and scaling
* Flexible CSS sizes for widths, heights, and fonts that work relative to the available space
* Use modern CSS layout tools like Flexbox or Grid vs. fixed sizes
* Show, hide, or re-arrange the layout elements based on available screen real estate
* CSS3 Media Queries using min-width, orientation, etc.
* Design for both Portrait and Landscape modes
* Optimize UI elements for Mouse/Keyboard AND Touch based events
* Make sure fonts, images, and icons work at every size and on every device
